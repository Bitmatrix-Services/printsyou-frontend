            PrintsYou requires a full payment to start production. All
            outstanding balances must be paid in full before any new order
            production can proceed. By signing the provided Order
            Acknowledgment, the buyer confirms entrance into a contractual
            agreement with PrintsYou and approves PrintsYou' permission to first
            apply any outstanding balance to the payment method provided, until
            said balance is paid in full, and then move forward with the payment
            terms as outlined below.

          <p className="font-medium text-mute3  text-[16px] leading-[30px] font-poppins">
            Terms are given at the discretion of PrintsYou. The full amount of
            an invoice can be charged to the supplied credit card on file at any
            point before, during, or after production. There is a $50.00 service
            fee for each returned check. All refunds of $100.00 or more will be
            returned by bank check within 10-15 business days via first class
            mail. If a Purchase Order is needed to submit or request payment,
            PrintsYou will provide the necessary paperwork to the buyer or
            buyer's accounting department at the time the order is placed.

            If payment terms are granted, the buyer agrees that late payment of
            an invoice will result in a 1.5% finance charge or the maximum
            charge permitted by law may be assessed against all accounts with
            past due balances. The buyer agrees to pay all PrintsYou' attorney

            PrintsYou of the buyer's offer to purchase goods and accept
            PrintsYou' terms and conditions. These initial records may contain
            terms that differ from those contained in the buyer's Purchase

            conditions its acceptance of the buyer's offer on PrintsYou' assent
            to the additional or differing terms. The buyer's receipt and
            retention of the goods shall constitute acceptance of any such
            additional or differing terms. The buyer and PrintsYou agree that

            Once the buyer confirms the Order Acknowledgement and Artwork

            time, PrintsYou cannot guarantee the ability to make changes or
            cancellations to an order. When an order is placed, it is processed
            and shipped quickly. If changes to an order are necessary, PrintsYou
            must be contacted immediately. Otherwise, said changes may not be
            able to be made before the order ships. If additional information is
            required, the sales representative involved will be available for

            PrintsYou will make every effort to comply with the buyer's
            cancellation request. If the buyer has already received the Order
            Acknowledgment, there will be a minimum charge of $50.00 to cover
            preparation expenses. In addition, the buyer is liable to pay the
            agreed upon price for any work completed up to the time that the
            order is cancelled. Cancellations result in the buyer being assessed
            for any production charges accrued at the time. These charges may
            include, but are not limited to: setup charges, artwork preparation
            charges, paper or product proofs, shipping charges, digitizing or
            embroidery, and restocking fees. All completed work and costs
            incurred will be the responsibility of the buyer. These fees will be

          <p className="font-medium text-mute3  text-[16px] leading-[30px] font-poppins pb-6">
            The best way to avoid cancellation fees is to make selections

            immediately or within 15 days of receipt at the very latest. After
            this time, PrintsYou will be unable to go back to suppliers for

            days of receipt of the merchandise. Claims made after this time will
            not be reviewed. Before PrintsYou can begin to process a claim, a
            sampling of the goods (quantity will be determined at PrintsYou'

            local taxes for services and goods shipped to Illinois and
            California. Additionally, if the item ordered ships from a warehouse
            located in the same state as the buyer, the buyer will be subject to
            their local state tax rate. Buyers in other states may be required
            to remit use taxes. Buyers are encouraged to consult a tax advisor
            if more specific information is needed. Companies, individuals, and

            on the part of the carrier who is delivering said merchandise. In
            rare instances, PrintsYou may ship the item after the intended ship

            PrintsYou requires that all new orders receive a Digital Proof and
            Order Acknowledgement prior to releasing the order to final
            production. A Digital Proof will be provided at no cost and is the
            best representation of what the final product will look like. The
            artwork will most often be to size or to scale (as indicated) and is
            only intended to provide the best possible idea of the completed
            product. Colors shown on digital proofs are not intended to be an
            exact representation of how the final imprint will look when
            printed. Due to the different calibrations of monitors, the colors
            shown may vary from screen to screen. If a specific color is needed
            for your logo, the buyer must let PrintsYou know the Pantone color
            which they would like to have printed.

          <p className="font-medium text-mute3  text-[16px] leading-[30px] font-poppins pb-6">
            If an error is discovered during order or artwork proofing, said
            error must be noted on the paperwork accordingly and/or the sales
            representative involved contacted. PrintsYou will make any
            corrections or changes promptly and for no additional charge. All
            changes must be confirmed in writing, preferably by email.

          <p className="font-medium text-mute3  text-[16px] leading-[30px] font-poppins pb-6">
            The Digital Proof and Order Acknowledgement are checked for
            misspellings and other mistakes (such as item colors, sizing,
            imprint color, imprint locations, etc.) but, due to order volume,
            there are rare instances when an error goes unnoticed. For this
            reason, PrintsYou highly recommends that the buyer carefully check
            all paperwork before signing off and submitting approval. PrintsYou
            cannot be held responsible for any incorrect interpretations of
            artwork or order approval. If additional information is required,
            the sales representative involved will be available for assistance

          <p className="font-medium text-mute3  text-[16px] leading-[30px] font-poppins pb-6">
            PrintsYou is not responsible for any typographical mistakes or
            errors that are overlooked and later approved by the buyer. For
            example, if an order is supposed to read "Congratulations", but the
            buyer approves the artwork with a typographical error reading
            "Congradulations" (a "d" instead of a "t"), PrintsYou cannot be held
            responsible for the misprint as a result of the error. Furthermore,
            PrintsYou cannot be held responsible for any damages that may be
            incurred as a result of the error after the order has been printed
            and accepted by the buyer. Once the buyer approves the Digital Proof
            and Order Acknowledgement, PrintsYou is not at liberty to make ANY
            changes to the order. Whether correct or with errors, the order is
            printed exactly as approved by the buyer. Therefore, it is EXTREMELY
            IMPORTANT for the buyer to carefully look over ALL paperwork before
            replying with approval.

            PrintsYou will size all artwork to utilize each item's maximum
            imprint area unless otherwise noted in writing by the buyer. Imprint
            areas are approximate and may vary from piece to piece. Due to the
            density of some items, a slight wrinkle may occur when the printing
            pad comes into contact with the item, which may result in a slight
            breakup of the imprint. Depending on product color, certain imprint
            colors will print differently. For instance, a blue imprint on a
            yellow product may appear with a green tint, a white imprint on a
            red product may appear with a pink tint, and so forth. Color
            misregistration of the industry standard of one sixteenth of an inch
            (1/16") is considered acceptable, but may differ depending on the
            item. Exact color replication for reorders may vary. Exact color
            replication for large order may vary. PMS Matching may be available
            depending on the item. Exact PMS Matching cannot be guaranteed. CMYK
            color matching process cannot be guaranteed. PrintsYou will advise
            the buyer of the best ink color for each product at the time of
            ordering.

            While QR codes are a convenient and widely used technology for

            guarantee that a QR code will print or scan correctly when printed.
            Several factors can impact the accuracy of the QR code, including

            the lighting conditions during the scanning process.
          </p>
          <p className="font-medium text-mute3  text-[16px] leading-[30px] font-poppins pb-6">
            Therefore, we strongly recommend that you thoroughly test the
            printed QR code to ensure its functionality before relying on it for
            important purposes, such as for business or marketing campaigns.
            Additionally, it is always a good practice to provide an alternative
            method for accessing the information encoded in the QR code, such as
            a URL or a text-based code, to ensure that users can still access
            the information even if the QR code is not functioning correctly. In
            some instances, a printer may charge a fee to print QR codes and
            PrintsYou will notify the buyer of any applicable fees.

          <p className="font-medium text-mute3  text-[16px] leading-[30px] font-poppins pb-6">
            PrintsYou works to provide clear and color-correct product images
            and descriptions on the website that best reflect the true nature of
            the products. Product descriptions (including, but not limited to,
            information about size, shape, and texture) are as accurate as
            possible. However, website images are inherently limited in their
            ability to communicate color, scale, and detail and PrintsYou
            cautions buyers to be careful about making assumptions strictly from
            the site image and description alone. Buyers are strongly encouraged
            to order actual samples. If the buyer chooses not to evaluate a
            physical sample, PrintsYou cannot be held responsible for
            discrepancies between the product description or site image as seen
            on a computer monitor and the final product.

            All of the content on this website, including, but not limited to,
            text, graphics, logos, button icons, images, and data, is the
            property of PrintsYou or the content suppliers. All of the content
            is protected by the United States and International Copyright Laws.
            Copyright is a form of protection provided by the laws of the United
            States (Title 17, U.S. Code) to the authors of "Original Works of
            Authorship" including literary, dramatic, musical, artistic, and
            certain other intellectual works. Copyright is secured automatically
            when a work is created. This protection is available to both
            published and unpublished works. Copyright protection subsists from
            the time the work is created in fixed form. The copyright in the
            work of authorship immediately becomes the property of the author
            who created the work. It is illegal for anyone to violate any of the
            rights provided by the Copyright Law.

            Violation of copyright protection is a very serious offense and
            PrintsYou will take the necessary steps to correct any illegal
            misuse of its proprietary content.
